    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Where app (the "App") and the location tracking service it provides (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Service is designed to be privacy-focused. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p>When you enable online tracking, the App sends your location data to our server. This data is identified only by a random, anonymous client ID that you can share with others. We do not associate this ID with any personal information.</p>
    <p>We collect crash logs via Firebase Crashlytics to improve app stability.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The location data is used solely to display your live location to anyone who has your client ID. The data is not stored long-term and is automatically deleted from our servers after a short period of inactivity.</p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your location data or any other information with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Live location data is temporary. We do not retain historical location data.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
