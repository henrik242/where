  ~
  ~ Background Location Usage Justification:
  ~ This GPS tracking app requires background location access as its core functionality.
  ~ Users explicitly start GPS tracking sessions to record their routes/tracks while
  ~ hiking, biking, or other outdoor activities. The app continues to record location
  ~ data when in the background so users can use other apps or lock their screen while
  ~ tracking their activity. This is critical for the app's primary purpose.
  ~
  ~ Foreground Service Justification:
  ~ The location foreground service displays a persistent notification showing active
  ~ GPS tracking status, ensuring users are always aware when location tracking is active.
  ~ This provides transparency and allows users to easily stop tracking from the notification.
